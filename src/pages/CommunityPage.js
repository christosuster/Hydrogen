            Truth be told, the world doesn't really need another agency. But it
            could always use a great place to work, collaborate, and make a
            positive impact. As strategists and creatives we see the value of
            our skillset going much further than the next campaign or piece of
            content. Our commitment to creating a diverse, equitable, and
            progressive world starts with ourselves, the organizations we
            support, the people we collaborate with and the ultimately the work
            we do. Check back here often to see what we've been up to and the
            friends/partnerships we've made along the way!

            <h3>Emerging Radiance Wins Tribeca X Award</h3>
            <p>
              Emerging Radiance: Honoring the Nikkei Farmers of Bellevue, WA has
              won the Tribeca X Award for best Immersive project! The Tribeca X
              Awards celebrate the achievement of best-in-class creators and
              companies who share a love of creativity and a mission to connect
              with consumers through the power of storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the award announcement Emerging Radiance was celebrated for how
              it combines art and AR, the physical and the digital, to bring
              history to the present and connect generations. Emerging Radiance
              animates the stories of Rae Matsuoka Takekawa, Mitsuko Hashiguchi
              and Toshio Ito, three Japanese American farmers who were part of a
              thriving community of Japanese Americans that were forcibly
              removed from their land in Bellevue, WA during the second World
              War. This award honors their legacy and is a testament to over a
              year of collective work by artist Michelle Kumata (
              <a href="#">@michellekumata</a>) and filmmaker Tani Ikeda (
              <a href="#">@taniikeda</a>) with Meta Open Arts and the support of
              local community members. Milli's role was to build an immersive
              web experience that best reflected the AR/physical experience of
              the exhibit. We're honored to have been a part of this amazing
              team.

              But not just any ADDY. It's our first one. And it's also our first
              time entering. The win is for a project very near and dear to our
              hearts: A film series as a love letter to the Seattle creative
              community and to the next generation of creators. With everything
              going on - including violence towards Asian Americans and
              Black/Brown folx - we recognize that it's more important than ever
              to tell their stories - our stories. Thank you AAF Seattle and the
              ADDY's for recognizing them!
